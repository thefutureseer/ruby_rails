Ruby on Rails, 
often referred to as just "Rails," 
is an open-source web application 
framework written in Ruby. It 
follows the Model-View-Controller 
(MVC) architectural pattern and 
provides a set of conventions and 
tools to streamline web development.

Here are some key features and 
concepts of Ruby on Rails:

Convention over Configuration: 
Rails follows the principle of convention 
over configuration, which means it makes 
assumptions about the best practices and 
default behaviors, reducing the need for 
explicit configuration.

Model-View-Controller (MVC): 
Rails uses the MVC pattern to separate the 
application's concerns into three main components: 
1. the model (handles data and business logic), 
2. the view (renders the user interface), and 
3. the controller (manages the flow of data and requests between the model and view).

Active Record: 
Active Record is Rails' object-relational 
mapping (ORM) library. It provides an interface 
to interact with the database, allowing you to 
define models as Ruby classes that correspond 
to database tables. Active Record handles the 
mapping between objects and database records, 
making database interactions easier.

Scaffolding: 
Rails provides scaffolding generators that 
automatically generate the basic code for 
creating, reading, updating, and deleting 
records for a particular model. It helps 
bootstrap a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, 
Delete) interface quickly.

RESTful Architecture: 
Rails encourages building RESTful 
applications by adhering to the 
principles of Representational 
State Transfer (REST). It promotes 
using standard HTTP methods (GET, 
POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD 
operations on resources.

Gems and Libraries: 
Rails has a vast ecosystem of gems 
and libraries that extend its 
functionality. These gems provide 
additional features such as 
authentication, authorization, 
testing frameworks, payment 
integration, and much more. 
You can easily integrate these 
gems into your Rails application 
to leverage their capabilities.

Testing Support: 
Rails has built-in support for 
testing with frameworks like 
MiniTest and RSpec. It encourages 
writing automated tests to ensure 
the quality and stability of your 
application.

Ruby on Rails has gained popularity 
due to its developer-friendly nature, 
rapid prototyping capabilities, and 
emphasis on convention and simplicity. 
It is used by many companies and 
developers worldwide to build robust 
and scalable web applications.
